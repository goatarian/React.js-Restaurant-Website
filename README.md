 <h2> Working </h2>
 <p> 
This project was developed as part of the GMU Patriot Hacks - 14 Days of Code event. Working as a team four we developed web application prototypes using react. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/restaurant-website-customizer?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress"> Devpost to our Team Project <a/> <br> </br>
The complete data is getting requested from firebase Realtime database, the components use that data to display the results, the components in menu, offers and other sections can then directly be modified by simply modifying the data in database, for example if the price of something changes or the image of some dish changes you don't have to modify the code, simply make the change in databse and it will be reflected on the website. For the routing purpose react-router is used and specifically hashBrowserRouter is used because it has enchanced performance on react Hosting. The hosting is done on firebase at <a href="https://twobrother-0927.firebaseapp.com/#/" target="_blank"> <abbr title="Link to my website"> Website</abbr></a>. Although not fully finished this project will be a continuing work for me. </p> 
 <p> I created this website recently to learn how to use react and javascript for a 14 days of code project. The credit in implementing this code comes from

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
